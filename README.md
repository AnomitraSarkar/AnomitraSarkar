## ⚙️ Who I am
I’m a Computer Science Engineer (VIT, Class of 2026) who gets a kick out of rewriting the rulebook. I ship full-stack apps, train ML models, design tiny DSLs, and prototype systems that force new questions. I like projects that blur the lines between software, hardware, and research.

Notable roles: AI Intern (Samsung PRISM) and Full Stack Application Developer (Stoodive). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 🧪 My hacker hobbies
- Building **bs-lang** — a small, meme-inspired programming language and tokenized syntax for playful experimentation.  
- Creating **SAFONA-JS**, a lightweight reactive DOM framework and client routing system. (npm package available.) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Research & optimization: published work on federated transfer learning (G-FTL Optimization). :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Low-level tinkering: Raspberry Pi integrations, telemetry dashboards, and lightweight in-memory DBs (BST Buffer DB + BBQL parser). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 🛠 Tech stack & languages
**Languages:** Go · JavaScript · Python · C/C++ · Java · SQL · x86/ARM assembly. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
**Frameworks / Tools:** Next.js · Tailwind · MERN · Node.js · LangChain · Kubernetes · Docker · Flutter · Firebase · TensorFlow/Keras. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 🚀 Projects worth poking
- **G-FTL Optimization (paper)** — Federated Transfer Learning research (arXiv). (See repo: `G-FTL-Optimization`). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- **BST Buffer Database + BBQL** — an in-memory DB with a custom query parser and optimized CRUD operations. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
- **SAFONA-JS** — lightweight reactive DOM framework and client-side routing (npm: `safona-js`). :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **Cheddar-AI / SIA** — automation agents, RAG pipelines, LLM integrations (Ollama / HF hosting). :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

(See my GitHub for code, demos, and live sites — I break things fast and document the repair logs.)

## ✨ How I work
- Prototype first: get a working proof-of-concept in hours, then iterate.  
- Data-driven decisions when possible (tests, benchmarks, CI).  
- Prefer minimal, composable tools: small APIs, fewer abstractions, clearer intent.  
- I love the uncomfortable part of a problem — that’s where interesting hacks live.

## 🎯 TL;DR
I’m the kind of engineer who will:
- write a tiny language to test a compiler idea,  
- build a reactive JS framework to test a UX pattern, then  
- wire them together with CI, a tiny DB, and a RAG pipeline — just to see what breaks.

If you want someone who turns vague constraints into savage prototypes, let’s talk.

> ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy designing DSLs and making frameworks that are intentionally opinionated and tiny.
