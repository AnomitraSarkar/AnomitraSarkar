## ⚙️ Who I am
I’m a Computer Science Engineer (VIT, Class of 2026) who gets a kick out of rewriting the rulebook.  
I ship full-stack apps, train ML models, design tiny DSLs, and prototype systems that ask new questions.  
I like projects that blur the lines between software, hardware, and research.

Notable roles: **AI Intern (Samsung PRISM)** · **Full Stack Application Developer (Stoodive)**

## 🧪 My hacker hobbies
- Building **bs-lang** — a meme-inspired programming language that turns programming into a joke *and* a challenge.  
- Creating **SAFONA-JS**, a lightweight reactive DOM framework with its own router and state logic.  
- Research & optimization: published work on **Federated Transfer Learning (G-FTL Optimization)**.  
- Low-level tinkering: **BST Buffer DB** (custom in-memory database) and **BBQL parser** for a query language I wrote for fun.  
- Experimenting with distributed systems, LLM pipelines, and self-hosted automation tools.

## 🛠 Tech stack & languages
**Languages:** Go · JavaScript · Python · C/C++ · Java · SQL · x86/ARM assembly  
**Frameworks / Tools:** Next.js · TailwindCSS · MERN · Node.js · LangChain · Kubernetes · Docker · Flutter · Firebase · TensorFlow/Keras

## 🚀 Projects worth poking
- **G-FTL Optimization (paper)** — Federated Transfer Learning research (arXiv).  
- **BST Buffer Database + BBQL** — in-memory DB with a custom query parser and optimized CRUD ops.  
- **SAFONA-JS** — lightweight reactive DOM framework and client-side routing system (npm: `safona-js`).  
- **Cheddar-AI / SIA** — automation agents, RAG pipelines, and LLM integrations (Ollama / HF hosting).  

> See my GitHub for code, demos, and live sites — I break things fast and document the repair logs.

## ✨ How I work
- Prototype first → proof-of-concept in hours, iterate later.  
- Data-driven validation → tests, benchmarks, CI.  
- Minimal abstractions → small APIs, clear intent.  
- I love the uncomfortable part of a problem — that’s where interesting hacks live.

## 🎯 TL;DR
I’m the kind of engineer who will:
- write a tiny language to test a compiler idea,  
- build a reactive JS framework to test a UX pattern, then  
- wire them together with CI, a tiny DB, and a RAG pipeline — just to see what breaks.

If you want someone who turns vague constraints into savage prototypes, let’s talk.

> ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy designing DSLs and making frameworks that are intentionally opinionated and tiny.
